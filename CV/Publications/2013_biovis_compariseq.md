abstract: "
<p>Comparing Sequence Charts (compariSeq) is a redesign of traditional sequence logos for the task of comparing multiple biological sequences. All relevant data encoded in traditional sequence logos is conserved, however, attention is directed to the most important data, colors are more perceptually accessible, and the task of direct comparison at particular locations is supported.</p>"

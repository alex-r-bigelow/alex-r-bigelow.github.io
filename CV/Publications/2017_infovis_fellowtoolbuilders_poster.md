abstract: "
<p>While it is true that fellow tool builders can threaten the success of a design study, there are also advantages to working with individuals that have strong software development skills. We present a review of two information visualization projects using thematic analysis, that provides additional insight and guidance for collaborating with people that have strong software development skills. Additionally, we discuss minor implications for the design of node-link diagrams and adjacency matrices, and report observed differences in engagement with respect to touch tables versus traditional keyboard, mouse, and monitor configurations.</p>"

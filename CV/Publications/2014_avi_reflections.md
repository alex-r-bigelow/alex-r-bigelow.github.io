abstract: "
<p>In recent years many popular data visualizations have emerged
that are created largely by designers whose main area of expertise
is not computer science. Designers generate these
visualizations using a handful of design tools and environments.
To better inform the development of tools intended
for designers working with data, we set out to understand designers’
challenges and perspectives. We interviewed professional
designers, conducted observations of designers working
with data in the lab, and observed designers working
with data in team settings in the wild. A set of patterns
emerged from these observations from which we extract a
number of themes that provide a new perspective on design
considerations for visualization tool creators, as well as on
known engineering problems.</p>"

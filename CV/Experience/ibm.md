During this three-month internship, we developed a system that supports traversing a large graph database in aggregate using graph pivots (we are finishing a paper on this subject that should be published soon).

Apache TinkerPop3 was released midway through this project, just as we had switched from a Neo4j graph database to a Titan database. I learned a lot about graph databases and graph query languages, and learned hard but valuable lessons about good documentation, developing for a moving target, and the dangers of vendor lock-in.

I'm a PhD student in the [Visualization Design Lab](http://vdl.sci.utah.edu) at the University of Utah's [SCI Institute](http://sci.utah.edu). I am interested in challenging the processes of data visualization, meaning:

- How do *people* go about extracting data and integrating it with other data?
  Are different (more efficient / expressive) workflows possible?
- How do *people* go about creating visual representations of data?
  Are different (more efficient / expressive) workflows possible?

These interrelated challenges are full of opportunities to develop solutions that enable new kinds of data analysis and visualization.

I’m a PhD student in the <a href="http://vdl.sci.utah.edu" target="_blank">Visualization Design Lab</a> at the University of Utah’s <a href="http://sci.utah.edu" target="_blank">SCI Institute</a>. My research interests target the challenging the processes involved in creating data visualizations, specifically:

- How do people iterate between different tools while creating and customizing a visualization?
- How do people iterate between different data attribute-to-visual encoding matchings?
- How do people go about reshaping data for use in a visualization?

With each of these challenges, my collaborators and I are asking:
- What are real practitioners doing now?
- How can we better support this process?
- Are different (more efficient / expressive) workflows possible?

These interrelated challenges are full of opportunities to develop solutions that enable new kinds of data analysis, visualization, and storytelling with visualization.

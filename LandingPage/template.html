<h1>Alex Bigelow</h1>

<p>I’m a PhD student in the <a href="http://vdl.sci.utah.edu" target="_blank">Visualization Design Lab</a> at the University of Utah’s <a href="http://sci.utah.edu" target="_blank">SCI Institute</a>. My research interests target the challenging the processes involved in creating data visualizations, specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do people iterate between different tools while creating and customizing a visualization?</li>
<li>How do people iterate between different data attribute-to-visual encoding matchings?</li>
<li>How do people go about reshaping data for use in a visualization?</li>
</ul>

<p>With each of these challenges, my collaborators and I are asking:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are real practitioners doing now?</li>
<li>How can we better support this process?</li>
<li>Are different (more efficient / expressive) workflows possible?</li>
</ul>

<p>These interrelated challenges are full of opportunities to develop solutions that enable new kinds of data analysis, visualization, and storytelling with visualization.</p>

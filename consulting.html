      <p>
        My services are available for free for University of Arizona Health Sciences
        groups, through my current role as a
        <a href="https://datascience.arizona.edu/data-science-fellows">UA Data Science Fellow</a>.
        I can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Help make fuzzy data or task requirements more crisp</li>
        <li>Act as a guide through the maze of data visualization and wrangling software possibilities</li>
        <li>Run visualization training or creativity workshops</li>
        <li>Build custom creative software, visual analytics systems, data wrangling tools, or other advanced web applications</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>
          Please note that I tend to decline or deflect requests to collaborate
          unless they're a <a href="#whats_a_good_fit">good fit</a>.
        </strong>
        Please don't take it personally if I seem hesitant&mdash;if working with
        me will waste your time, I'll do my best to let you to know right away.
      </p>
    </div>

      <h3 id="whats_a_good_fit">What makes a "good fit?"</h3>
      <p>
        The most important indicator to me that a collaboration will go well is
        <strong>access</strong>. Not enough access means that your project probably
        isn't quite ready for someone like me yet, and I'll probably just steer you
        toward relevant resources to help you get there.
      </p>
      <h4>Access to people</h4>
      <p>
        Do people in your organization already have some of the
        <a href="#roles">roles on this page</a>?
        Great! How much of their time can they afford to spend meeting with me?
      </p>
      <p>
        It's especially important for me to have access to the real users and
        consumers of any systems or visualizations that we create: just as unit
        tests are critical to guarantee bug-free software, interviews and user
        testing are critical to guarantee that software will be useful.
      </p>
      <p>
        My first objective&mdash;both in terms of order and priority&mdash;is to
        create and update an evolving design document that details diverse
        stakeholder needs. <strong>I view software prototypes and systems as
        secondary means to better understand and achieve the needs of people,
        not ends in and of themselves.</strong> This often results in throwing
        code out, rewriting it, or building new systems from scratch. The sunk
        cost fallacy can be really strong in these projects, but I don't view
        discarding months of coding as a failure if the code taught us something
        that changed the design document.
      </p>
      <h4>Access to data</h4>
      <p>
        How much time will it take for me to get access to real data?
      </p>
      <p>
        Real data behavior is almost always different from what you expect, and
        it's usually different enough that it breaks any early visualization
        designs that we might imagine. But, if the context and goals of the
        project are well-understood, the way that data breaks things often
        inspires truly innovative visualization designs: "necessity is the
        mother of invention" definitely applies to working with data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Without understanding what necessities the data are imposing, it's a
        <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2012.213">well-documented</a>
        phenomenon that the lack of real data can spell serious trouble for a
        project.
        If you're still working on collecting data, or still thinking about
        what data you should collect, this isn't necessarily a
        deal-breaker&mdash;but we'll need to be especially careful early on to
        establish a healthy
        <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934285">culture of data review</a>.
      </p>

    <div>
      <h3 id="roles">What I do</h3>
      <p>
        Designing for data is hard (I've
        <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/2598153.2598175">published</a>
        <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598609">several</a>

        <a href="http://hdc.cs.arizona.edu/papers/infovis_2020_abstractionGuidelines.pdf">about</a>
        why it's hard!), and that means that it's really important for me to
        (1) interact directly with people in your organization that wear very
        different hats, and (2) pivot frequently between wearing many of these
        hats myself.

        Have a specific technology that you need me to work with?
        Here's an overview of what I've dealt with in the past, and what I'd
        like an excuse to learn more about.

        (Salty opinion): these lists can never be exhaustive, nor do they
        indicate what a candidate can learn, so I didn't bother organizing it.
        Control (or Command) + F is your friend.

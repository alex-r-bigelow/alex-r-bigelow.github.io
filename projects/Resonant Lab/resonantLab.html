  <h1>Resonant Lab</h1>
  This is a project I developed while an intern at Kitware, Inc. that assists
  novice users in connecting arbitrary datasets to arbitrary visualizations.
  The visualizations include new, cutting-edge research visualizations that can
  be incorporated as they are developed, rather than waiting for these new
  techniques to appear in proprietary visualization toolkits.

  Check out the <a href="https://resonantlab.kitware.com/">deployed tool</a> for
  more information.

abstract: "
<p>Bob Ross is the inspirational PBS painter that we all know and love from the 1980's and the 1990's. Ross made painting fun and relaxing with his easy going attitude and light hearted vocabulary. Bob Ross didn't believe in mistakes, only happy accidents which encouraged many people to start painting. Ross' purpose with his show \"The Joy of Painting\" was to spread the love and happiness that comes from painting beautiful landscapes of all kinds.</p>
<p>From these wonderful landscapes, we wanted to learn more about the amazing Bob Ross. Some initial ideas were to study his speech, his choice of colors, the similarities or differences between all of his paintings, and if he changed his style throughout the seasons of his show. </p>"

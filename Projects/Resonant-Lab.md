# Resonant Lab
This is a project I developed while an intern at Kitware, Inc. that assists novice users in connecting arbitrary datasets to arbitrary visualizations. The visualizations include new, cutting-edge research visualizations that can be incorporated as they are developedâ€”rather than waiting for these new techniques to appear in proprietary visualization toolkits.

Check out the live site [here](https://resonantlab.kitware.com/).

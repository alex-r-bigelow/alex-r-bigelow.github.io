        A place where I dump an unorganized mess of informal things that I
        write... things like obscure technical how-tos that are mostly reminder
        lists for myself, half-baked sales pitches, punditry about the future of
        software, and&mdash;if I'm ever brave enough&mdash;whiny rants about my
        escape from Mormonism and how to deal with people that have deeply
        problematic worldviews like the ones I grew up with.

        of any past or present employer or research collaborator.

        Parting thought: If the list on the right is infuriating for its lack of
        interactivity, shoot me an email. Seriously. That might be all it takes
        to motivate me to put some order into this.

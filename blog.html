          This unorganized mess is where I dump reminders to myself about how I
          did that one thing that one time, that nobody else seemed to have
          written down.

          If you're looking for more serious, peer-reviewed writing about
          slightly more important things, click on the titles in my

          Any opinions here are my own, and are very unlikely to represent those
          of any past or present employer or research collaborator. Technical
          guides are <b>probably</b> out of date&mdash;again, these are
          reminders mostly for myself.

            If the disorder of the list on the left / bottom, or the lack of
            anything up-to-date or useful here bothers you, please shoot me an
            email! Seriously. Squeaky wheels are the things that get grease;
            knowing that anybody is actually poking around in this weird corner
            of the internet might be all it takes to motivate me to update
            things, write more frequently, add some basic tagging, filtering,
            etc.

How I Lost My Faith In Computer Science
=======================================

- cs is a major world religion. We're wizards that perform magic for people. They pay us insane amounts of money, because our more-intelligent-than-thou attitude convinces them that there's *something* separating us and them that gives us this power that they still don't believe that they can personally wield.
- growing to see the for loop for what it is... a tool. Not magic. It won't solve everything, even though we, ourselves, have been *indoctrinated* to believe that it does.
- once I realized my zeal for a pythagorean math cult-like religion surrounding the all-powerful for loop, the imperialism of my attitudes toward collaborators was laid bare

Other loose ideas:
- scalability in terms of data gets cs people hard... to the point that all other forms of efficiency get ignored. Optimizing the wrong thing is a fatal mistake---that's the whole fucking point of big-O---but when we ignore the human's actual needs and assume that data size is the challenge that people need conquered, we miss the whole fucking point of computing.

Most visualization toolkits follow a pattern where users never actually draw graphics directly.
Instead, they follow a set of formal rules **for every item in a dataset** in order to generate graphics.

This for loop is baked into every automated vis toolkit in existence.
It's the central operation around which the entire interface is built; it's the *magic* that makes software so cool.

To programmers.

As a programmer that was interested in "solving" visualization for creatives like graphic designers, I was initially *appalled* to discover that designers commonly still draw visualizations one point at a time.
It's the 21st century... don't they know that there's a *better way*?

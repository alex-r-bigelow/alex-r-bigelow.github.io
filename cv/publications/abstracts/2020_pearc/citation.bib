  abstract = {We describe an interactive computing environment called JetLag. JetLag implements the following features of Phylanx project: (1) Phylanx, a Python-based asynchronous array computing toolkit; (2) the APEX performance measurement library; (3) a performance visualization framework called Traveler; (4) the Tapis/Agave Science as a Service middleware; and (6) a container infrastructure that includes Docker-based Jupyter notebook for the client and a singularity image for the server. The running system starts with a user performing array computations on their workstation or laptop. If, at some point, the calculation the user is performing becomes sufficiently intensive or numerous, it can be packaged and sent to another machine where it will run (through the batch queue system if there is one), produce a result, and have that result sent back to the user’s local interface. Whether the calculation is local or remote, the user will be able to use APEX and Traveler to diagnose and fix performance related problems. The JetLag system is suitable for a variety of array computational tasks, including machine learning and exploratory data analysis. },

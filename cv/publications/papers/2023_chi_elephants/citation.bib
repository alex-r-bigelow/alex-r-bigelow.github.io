abstract = {Two people looking at the same dataset will create different mental models, prioritize different attributes, and connect with different visualizations. We seek to understand the space of data abstractions associated with mental models and how well people communicate their mental models when sketching. Data abstractions have a profound influence on the visualization design, yet itâ€™s unclear how universal they may be when not initially influenced by a representation. We conducted a study about how people create their mental models from a dataset. Rather than presenting tabular data, we presented each participant with one of three datasets in paragraph form, to avoid biasing the data abstraction and mental model. We observed various mental models, data abstractions, and depictions from the same dataset, and how these concepts are influenced by communication and purpose-seeking. Our results have implications for visualization design, especially during the discovery and data collection phase.},

Many data abstraction types, such as networks or set relationships, remain unfamiliar to data workers beyond the
visualization research community. We conduct a survey and series of interviews about how people describe their data, either directly or
indirectly. We refer to the latter as latent data abstractions. We conduct a Grounded Theory analysis that (1) interprets the extent to
which latent data abstractions exist, (2) reveals the far-reaching effects that the interventionist pursuit of such abstractions can have on
data workers, (3) describes why and when data workers may resist such explorations, and (4) suggests how to take advantage of
opportunities and mitigate risks through transparency about visualization research perspectives and agendas. We then use the themes
and codes discovered in the Grounded Theory analysis to develop guidelines for data abstraction in visualization projects. To continue
the discussion, we make our dataset open along with a visual interface for further exploration.

For two years, I developed and experimented with Next-Generation Sequencing processing and analysis tools. We also worked with large pedigrees from the [Utah Population Database](http://healthcare.utah.edu/huntsmancancerinstitute/research/updb/).

I gained firsthand exposure to large, messy, and heavily nuanced data. We also grappled with task ambiguityâ€”as these are new, rich resources, they present truly wicked problems: once we could see one pattern in the data, it made us ask questions that need an entirely different perspectives. I was also able to observe the difficulties, potential errors, and lack of standards and support that domain scientists face when trying to work with new kinds of data.

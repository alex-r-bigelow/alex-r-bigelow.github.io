During this three-month internship, we developed Jacob's Ladder, a system that supports traversing a large graph database in aggregate using graph pivots.

Apache TinkerPop3 was released midway through this project, just as we had switched from a Neo4j graph database to a Titan database. I learned a lot about graph databases and graph query languages, and learned hard but valuable lessons about good documentation, developing for a moving target, and the dangers of vendor lock-in.

I volunteered on the SCI Institute's student committee. Responsibilities included:

- Planning and carrying out the [SCI X](http://sci.utah.edu/the-institute/events/day/20161116.html) exhibition in 2016. This included creating an [interactive map](https://github.com/SCIInstitute/scix-map) to assist visitors in navigating the event via a large touch table kiosk and visitors' devices. The map has been used for subsequent in-house exhibitions, even after I graduated

- Planning and carrying out other Institute parties and social activities. This included mocking up an [interface](https://github.com/alex-r-bigelow/ping-pong-tournament) for managing an in-house ping pong tournament

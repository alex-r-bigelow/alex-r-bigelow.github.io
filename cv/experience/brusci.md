I volunteered on the SCI Institute's student committee. Responsibilities have included:
- Deep involvement in planning and carrying out the [SCI X](http://sci.utah.edu/the-institute/events/day/20161116.html) exhibition in 2016. This included creating an [interactive map](https://github.com/alex-r-bigelow/scix-map) for a display table and visitors' devices
- Planning and carrying out Institute parties. This included mocking up an [interface](https://github.com/alex-r-bigelow/ping-pong-tournament) for managing an in-house ping pong tournament

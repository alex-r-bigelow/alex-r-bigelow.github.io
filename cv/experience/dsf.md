The University of Arizona Data Science Fellow program included a period of intense training in which each fellow instructed the others in specific data science disciplines; for example, in my case, I developed and conducted a series of trainings in data visualization.

We also engaged with University projects in the Health Sciences and adjacent organizations; my involvement included working with [Arizona Research Bazaar](https://researchbazaar.arizona.edu/) to help with campus computing outreach efforts, as well as [HCW HOSTED](https://hcwhosted.org/) to provide resources for healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

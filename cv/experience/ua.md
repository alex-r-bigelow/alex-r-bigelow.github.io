As a postdoctoral researcher, I studied the impacts that different data abstractions (e.g. tables, graphs, set relationships, points in real or high-dimensional spaces, etc) can have on visualization design and analysis—data formats, databases, and structures can have strong impacts on the kinds of charts that creative infographic designers think to draw, and the kinds of analysis questions that scientists think to ask!

I also worked with HPC researchers—including working closely with two exceptional PhD students—on techniques for scalably visualizing performance data for new approaches to programming supercomputers:

- [Sayef Azad Sakin](https://sayefsakin.blogspot.com/p/about-me.html)

I was nominated for, and participated in, the University of Arizona's Data Science Fellow program. This included a period of intense training in which each fellow instructed the others in specific data science disciplines; for example, in my case, I developed and conducted a series of trainings in data visualization.

We also engaged with University projects in the Health Sciences and adjacent organizations; my involvement included working with [Arizona Research Bazaar](https://researchbazaar.arizona.edu/) to help with campus computing outreach efforts, as well as [HCW HOSTED](https://hcwhosted.org/) to provide resources for healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

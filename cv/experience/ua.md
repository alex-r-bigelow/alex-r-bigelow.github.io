As a postdoctoral researcher, I researched, published, and submitted a grant (that wasn't funded) to study the impacts that different data abstractions can have on visualization design and analysis.

I was also privileged to work closely with two exceptional PhD students:

- [Katy Williams](https://www.davidson.edu/people/katy-williams)
- [Sayef Azad Sakin](https://sayefsakin.blogspot.com/p/about-me.html)

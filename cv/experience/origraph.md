I'm currently working on a startup company, supporting creative data workers' creativity through [an online hypergraph editor / modeling tool](https://www.origraph.net).

Currently, it's a fairly work-in-progress effort; hopefully there will be more to see / discuss here in a few months!

If you're considering hiring me, and concerned about how important this might be to me, this project is still absolutely something at the early stages that I'd be happy to sideline as a side-hustle, or simply release as open source.

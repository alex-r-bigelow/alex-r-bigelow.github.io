I regularly benefit from, and endeavor to assist with, a non-profit Tucson community group that provides regular meetups and an annual festival of workshops, for researchers with diverse applied programming, data science, visualization, or other technology training and support.

Aside from helping to organize events, teaching workshops, and (free) individual consulting, I built and maintain the AZ Research Bazaar website.

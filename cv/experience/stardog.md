At Stardog, I helped design, implement ship, and maintain several user-facing applications (and associated libraries and Cloud UI), used by all of Stardog's customers and beyond. These included:

- Stardog Designer, a graph modeling and mapping tool which was largely based off my Origraph research work
- Stardog Explorer, a simple node-link diagram visualization tool with an accessible (yet very expressive) visual query building interface
- Stardog Studio, an IDE for writing and editing queries, and managing Stardog databases and virtual graphs

I was also heavily involved in the design and integration of Stardog Voiceboxâ€”a Large Language Model-powered chat assistant that translated natural language into SPARQL queries, executed the queries against data in Stardog, and summarized the results with an explainable UX with citations and a visual rendering of the query, that communicated exactly how the AI was able to find its answers.

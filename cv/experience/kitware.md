During this seven-month internship, I was privileged to work on [Resonant Lab](https://resonantlab.kitware.com), a system that enables connecting arbitrary datasets to arbitrary visualizations. This work culminated in a Best Paper Award at the Visualization In Practice Workshop (VIP '16).

I gained a lot of experience with real-world software development, and building better-quality software than I normally have time for in academia was incredibly satisfying. Working in an industry research lab like this was great because it gave me the flexibility to think deeply about problems and approach them in non-conventional ways, but at the same time, it provided the support and priority structure to develop high-quality software.

Working for Kitware was also a valuable experience because of its focus on open-source development; regardless of my future career, I hope to be able to continue working with what we started here.

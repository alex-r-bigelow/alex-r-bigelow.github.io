To solve this problem, we have developed and informally tested two open source systems. The first, Candela, is a framework and API for creating visualization components for the web that can wrap up new or existing visualizations as needed. Because Candela’s API generalizes the inputs to a visualization, we have also developed a system called Resonant Laboratory that makes it possible for novice users to connect arbitrary datasets to Candela visualizations. Together, these systems enable novice users to explore and share their data with the growing library of state-of-the-art visualization techniques.\n",

These csv files had to be refactored a number of times</li>\n<li><strong>M2</strong>: Though the student committee worked hard for weeks to get details, I ended up having to come in at night to collect poster location information myself, once the posters were finally set up. <strong>I3</strong>'s assigned area was particularly problematic, because the location was changed last-minute</li>\n<li><strong>M3</strong>: Using an Illustrator SVG map made annotating (e.g. adding restrooms to the map) / changing area shapes easy; most changes in the git history were changes to the spaceAssignments.csv file</li>\n<li><strong>M4</strong>: <strong>I4</strong> provided useful feedback about the width of the selection bars above each poster name (they were initially squares and hard to click directly, even though the whole text block was technically clickable), but also provided (too much?) feedback about things like typography</li>\n<li><strong>M5</strong>: An institution-wide meeting (mostly about making sure people created / printed their posters on time) quickly devolved into a debate about the interface… particularly with respect to the map orientation (should North be up? But people exit the elevator, and initially encounter the interactive interface facing South…). However, an important development in this meeting occurred when the task abstraction of the interface changed---some participants indicated that they knew specific visitors that would want to be able to locate individual posters.</li>\n<li><strong>M6</strong>: Public display on a touch table likely contributed to high engagement - my personal demo was on an equally-sized monitor immediately off the elevator, but most visitors would walk right past me to the touch display in the room behind me (of course, I didn't actively try to stop people to see my demo, and it makes sense that people would want to first orient themselves in a new environment)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"pingpongtournamentextracts\">Ping Pong Tournament Extracts</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>P1</strong>: Instead of CSV files on GitHub, we used Google forms / sheets as a pseudo-database for the ping pong tournament. We still used GitHub for hosting the site, but this meant that committee members could check / edit the spreadsheets easily</li>\n<li><strong>P2</strong>: Setting up a debug / simulation mode was helpful during the live ping pong deployment - <strong>I6</strong> in particular responded quickly to requests to beta test changes to the site before they went live. Because of the google spreadsheets setup, it was easy to see and debug what tests he used to try (and, in some cases, succeed) to trigger bugs.</li>\n<li><strong>P3</strong>: <strong>I5</strong>, <strong>I6</strong>, and <strong>I7</strong> had very specific ideas of how the pool play / bracket should work. As such, I planned (and succeeded) to outsource the seeding of the bracket to them via a Google spreadsheet</li>\n<li><strong>P4</strong>: Shortly after the first debugging deployment, <strong>I8</strong> designed and printed promotional posters using the background image… but chose a very different font style and color scheme. Rather than reprint the posters, we felt it best to refactor the interactive system.</li>\n<li><strong>P5</strong>: This interface required typing in information---initially, we planned to deploy the interface on a touch table, as we had with the open house map. The touch table has a built-in keyboard that can be swiped in from the side---but we needed to add an icon to the interface to make this clear. However, due to a more important project needing the touch table, we had to instead deploy the interface on a monitor by the elevator (actually the same monitor where I gave my demo in the open house), with a keyboard and mouse attached</li>\n<li><strong>P6</strong>: We initially anticipated more participants---because the limited number that actually signed up was much lower (the vis deadline was partly to blame---we later heard that many more would have signed up, but they were too busy with submissions), we decided to include everyone in the bracket. This necessitated a last-minute rewrite of the code to include BYE / PASS nodes for the highest-seeded players</li>\n<li><strong>P7</strong>: It proved difficult to get people to actually play their games, particularly when the scheduled players didn't know each other well. Eventually, we had to add forfeits to the pool play phase (again, necessitating a last-minute redesign of the system). This happened again in the bracket---some students began leaving for the summer. Luckily, the few that had left were able to nominate the player they had most recently defeated to play for them, and the change was a simple adjustment to the spreadsheets (more drastic rewrites of the system were not necessary)</li>\n<li><strong>P8</strong>: Our initial plan was for all participants to pick a charity to represent (<strong>I1</strong> provided a CSV list of 503(c)(3) charities), and non-players could still participate by \"betting\" on players. However, this garnered little attention / participation. Toward the beginning of the bracket phase, <strong>I6</strong> suggested that we implement a March Madness-style approach, where people could submit their own brackets, and award a secondary prize to the charity picked by the most accurate bracket. Unfortunately, this was too difficult to implement in the short amount of time left in the tournament.</li>\n<li><strong>P9</strong>: Having the public display also appeared to result in high engagement, though not as much as I observed with the touch table. Passers-by seemed to be hesitant to use the keyboard / mouse… this may have had something to do with the permanent nature of the display (attached to the wall) - normally, the monitor showed a looping video of demonstrations, that people would not normally interfere with.</li>\n<li><strong>P10</strong>: Some passers-by reported confusion about the triangular edges, particularly in the node-link diagram (are triangles arrowheads pointing to the winner, or does the larger side indicate the winner)?</li>\n<li><strong>P11</strong>: Though most people that interacted with the interface were very technically savvy, the pool play adjacency matrices proved confusing to some people (not all, however… some people even commented on how intuitive they were). In their design, <strong>I3</strong> provided very useful feedback---initially, I displayed an arrow for an already-played game, pointing to the winner. However, <strong>I3</strong> made it clear that this was confusing; instead, redundantly displaying the name of the winner in the cell made more sense.</li>\n<li><strong>P12</strong>: <strong>I6</strong> contributed a very minor code fix</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"opencodes\">Open Codes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>O1</strong>: Last-minute system adjustments were common (<strong>M2</strong>, <strong>P4</strong>, <strong>P5</strong>, <strong>P6</strong>, <strong>P7</strong>, <strong>P8</strong>)</li>\n<li><strong>O2</strong>: Clever engineering tricks made most last-minute adjustments easier to handle (<strong>M3</strong>, <strong>P1</strong>, <strong>P2</strong>, <strong>P7</strong>)</li>\n<li><strong>O3</strong>: Actual code contributions from collaborators were rare (<strong>P12</strong>)</li>\n<li><strong>O4</strong>: Spreadsheets encouraged more collaborator help (<strong>M1</strong>, <strong>P1</strong>)</li>\n<li><strong>O5</strong>: Overall, mixed results getting data from collaborators (<strong>M2</strong>, <strong>P2</strong>, <strong>P3</strong>, <strong>P8</strong>)</li>\n<li><strong>O6</strong>: Confusion about triangular edges (<strong>P10</strong>)</li>\n<li><strong>O7</strong>: Confusion / intuition about rotated adjacency matrices (<strong>P11</strong>)</li>\n<li><strong>O8</strong>: Collaborators' feedback (mostly) insightful (<strong>M4</strong>, <strong>M5</strong>, <strong>P2</strong>, <strong>P11</strong>)</li>\n<li><strong>O9</strong>: Touch table more engaging than monitor + keyboard / mouse (<strong>M6</strong>, <strong>P9</strong>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"themes\">Themes</h1>\n<h2 id=\"collaboratorparticipation\">Collaborator Participation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>A1</strong>: Collaborator technical involvement in the project varied; personality seemed to dictate whether and how much people contributed, rather than interest in the overall project or interest in the technical aspects (<strong>O3</strong>, <strong>O4</strong>, <strong>O5</strong>). Technical involvement did <em>not</em> seem to have any relationship with relevant technical skills (<strong>O3</strong>; <strong>I6</strong> is not a web developer).</li>\n<li><strong>A2</strong>: Collaborators most readily participated when the tools were familiar; google sheets (even with strict rules about structure) were the most freely adjusted. Github CSV files came in second, beta testing the interface itself came in third, and the interface code was barely touched (<strong>O3</strong>, <strong>O4</strong>, <strong>O5</strong>).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"collaboratorfeedback\">Collaborator Feedback</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>A3</strong>: Most feedback was helpful; compared to non-developer users in typical design studies, people seemed more willing to provide critique (<strong>O8</strong>). The kinds of critique that collaborators suggested tended to be more bounded by their technical knowledge of what is easily changed, and what is difficult to implement (<strong>01</strong>, <strong>02</strong>, <strong>08</strong>)</li>\n<li><strong>A4</strong>: Some feedback was too specific or failed to capture the scope of the project; dealing with this gracefully is tricky. However, it was a pitfall to automatically assume that all feedback was too specific (<strong>O8</strong>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"implicationsforvisualizationtechniquesanddeployment\">Implications for Visualization Techniques and Deployment</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>A5</strong>: Adjacency matrices were confusing to a subset of a <em>technical</em> audience (<strong>O7</strong>)! Artifact of rotated design?</li>\n<li><strong>A6</strong>: Triangles as arrows are ambiguous (<strong>O6</strong>)</li>\n<li><strong>A7</strong>: Touch table more engaging than fixed monitor (<strong>O9</strong>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"keytakeaways\">Key Takeaways</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Just because a collaborator has the technical ability and the time to contribute, that doesn't mean that they will (<strong>A1</strong>, <strong>A2</strong>)</li>\n<li>The opposite is also true: just because a collaborator doesn't appear to have the technical ability or the time to contribute, that doesn't mean that they won't (<strong>A1</strong>, <strong>A2</strong>)</li>\n<li>Concern about working with fellow tool builders is warranted, but they should not necessarily be avoided---their expertise can be an incredible asset (<strong>A3</strong>, <strong>A4</strong>)</li>\n<li>Some minor details of node-link diagrams and adjacency matrices can have a profound effect on the ability of users to make sense of what is represented (<strong>A5</strong>, <strong>A6</strong>)---where these are employed, a legend is probably necessary</li>\n<li>Touch table vs traditional display: the former seems to naturally produce more engagement / willingness to mess with the system (<strong>A7</strong>)</li>\n</ul>",

          "contents": "When interpreting data as a graph for visualization, an analyst first assigns semantic meaning to graph concepts. For example, they may choose to represent actors and movies as nodes, and roles as edges. Alternatively, they may wish to represent movies as edges, connecting actor nodes when they collaborate. Data abstraction choices such as these are critical, because different data abstractions can limit—or inspire—different analysis questions, approaches, perspectives, and visualizations.\n\nHowever, current network modeling frameworks, systems, and databases narrowly define graph abstraction constructs—such as nodes, edges, node / edge classes, supernodes, hyperedges, etc.—in terms of how the data is stored in memory or on disk, rather than semantic, human-driven abstractions. Consequently, the ability of an analyst to iterate on a data abstraction becomes fundamentally limited by the implementation details of data wrangling software.\n\nWe present work-in-progress toward a broader framework for modeling network data that is less dependent on its underlying structure and storage. Our goal is to use semantic data abstraction constructs to inform how algorithms wrangle data, instead of allowing algorithmic concerns to define and constrain the semantics.\n\nWe also present mure.js, a software library that represents an initial implementation of this framework, allowing users to map semantic graph constructs to arbitrary data structures as metadata, that can, in turn, be used to select, navigate, and reshape the under- lying data. Additionally, we discuss an early software prototype of a visual graph wrangling system based on this library.\n",

Designers generate these visualizations using a handful of design tools and environments. To better inform the development of tools intended for designers working with data, we set out to understand designers’ challenges and perspectives. We interviewed professional designers, conducted observations of designers working with data in the lab, and observed designers working with data in team settings in the wild. A set of patterns emerged from these observations from which we extract a number of themes that provide a new perspective on design considerations for visualization tool creators, as well as on known engineering problems.\n",

          "contents": "The findings from genome-wide association studies hold enormous potential for novel insight into disease mechanisms. A major challenge in the field is to map these low-risk association signals to their underlying functional sequence variants(FSV). Simple sequence study designs are insufficient, as the vast numbers of statistically comparable variants and a limited knowledge of noncoding regulatory elements complicate prioritization. Furthermore, large sample sizes are typically required for adequate power to identify the initial association signals. One important question is whether similar sample sizes need to be sequenced to identify the FSVs. Here, we present a proof-of-principle example of an extreme discordant design to map FSVs within the 2q33 low-risk breast cancer locus. Our approach employed DNA sequencing of a small number of discordant haplotypes to efficiently identify candidate FSVs. Our results were consistent with those from a 2,000-fold larger, traditional imputation-based fine-mapping study. To prioritize further, we used expression-quantitative trait locus analysis of RNA sequencing from breast tissues, gene regulation annotations from the ENCODE consortium, and functional assays for differential enhancer activities. Notably, we implicate three regulatory variants at 2q33 that target CASP8 (rs3769823,rs3769821 in CASP8, and rs10197246 in ALS2CR12) as functionally relevant. We conclude that nested discordant haplotype sequencing is a promising approach to aid mapping of low-risk association loci. The ability to include more efficient sequencing designs into mapping efforts presents an opportunity for the field to capitalize on the potential of association loci and accelerate translation of association signals to their underlying FSVs.\n",

Unfortunately, this is typically a one-way process: once a visualization is exported from the generative tool into a drawing tool, it is difficult to make further, data-driven changes. In this paper, we propose a bridge model to allow designers to bring their work back from the drawing tool to re-edit in the generative tool. Our key insight is to recast this iteration challenge as a merge problem - similar to when two people are editing a document and changes between them need to reconciled. We also present a specific instantiation of this model, a tool called Hanpuku, which bridges between D3 scripts and Illustrator. We show several examples of visualizations that are iteratively created using Hanpuku in order to illustrate the flexibility of the approach. We further describe several hypothetical tools that bridge between other visualization tools to emphasize the generality of the model.\n",

While it is often prudent to avoid such projects, we argue it can be beneficial to engage them in some cases as the visualization process can help refine data collection, solving a “chicken and egg” problem of having the data and tools to analyze it. We found this to be the case in the domain of task parallel computing where such data and tooling is an open area of research. Despite these hurdles, we conducted a design study. Through a tightly-coupled iterative design process, we built Atria, a multi-view execution graph visualization to support performance analysis. Atria simplifies the initial representation of the execution graph by aggregating nodes as related to their line of code. We deployed Atria on multiple platforms, some requiring design alteration. We describe how we adapted the design study methodology to the “moving target” of both the data and the domain experts’ concerns and how this movement kept both the visualization and programming project healthy. We reflect on our process and discuss what factors allow the project to be successful in the presence of changing data and user needs.\n",

          "contents": "This paper reports on a simple visual technique that boils extracting a subgraph down to two operations—pivots and filters—that is agnostic to both the data abstraction, and its visual complexity scales independent of the size of the graph. The system’s design, as well as its qualitative evaluation with users, clarifies exactly when and how the user’s intent in a series of pivots is ambiguous—and, more usefully, when it is not. Reflections on our results show how, in the event of an ambiguous case, this innately practical operation could be further extended into “smart pivots” that anticipate the user’s intent beyond the current step. They also reveal ways that a series of graph pivots can expose the semantics of the data from the user’s perspective, and how this information could be leveraged to create adaptive data abstractions that do not rely as heavily on a system designer to create a comprehensive abstraction that anticipates all the user’s tasks.\n",

          "contents": "Networks are a natural way of thinking about many datasets. The data on which a network is based, however, is rarely collected in a form that suits the analysis process, making it necessary to create and reshape networks. Data wrangling is widely acknowledged to be a critical part of the data analysis pipeline, yet interactive network wrangling has received little attention in the visualization research community. In this paper, we discuss a set of operations that are important for wrangling network datasets and introduce a visual data wrangling tool, Origraph, that enables analysts to apply these operations to their datasets. Key operations include creating a network from source data such as tables, reshaping a network by introducing new node or edge classes, filtering nodes or edges, and deriving new node or edge attributes. Our tool, Origraph, enables analysts to execute these operations with little to no programming, and to immediately visualize the results. Origraph provides views to investigate the network model, a sample of the network, and node and edge attributes. In addition, we introduce interfaces designed to aid analysts in specifying arguments for sensible network wrangling operations. We demonstrate the usefulness of Origraph in two Use Cases: first, we investigate gender bias in the film industry, and then the influence of money on the political support for the war in Yemen.\n",

Many misunderstandings arise from what appears to be common knowledge to a domain scientist, but is not something that a computer scientist would think to ask about. The use of experimental visualization as an inter-collaboration communication tool can highlight these important misunderstandings that would otherwise severely impair the collaboration.\n\nVisualization itself, however, is a powerful tool; if used carefully it can open doors to understanding and discovery, but it can also control, warp, or even limit how a visualization designer (and consequently a scientist) thinks about a problem. A willingness to abandon erroneous designs and even systems, regardless of the effort involved in creating and understanding them, is also very important for such a collaboration.\n\nThis case study of data exploration via experimental visualization is in the space of next-generation sequencing data. For most of the history of genetics, the main bottleneck in the rate of discovery has been the difficulty in obtaining data. Next generation sequencing is a relatively new technology that allows biologists a way to obtain genetic data at a fraction of the cost and unprecedented speeds compared to conventional sequencing. With the advent of NGS data, the bottleneck has shifted from the burden of data acquisition to the analysis of huge amounts of data.\n",

          "contents": "Iteration is a ubiquitous need across many different visualization design workflows. For visual design, practitioners often need to transition between the automated generation of visuals and manual drawing; however, existing software makes free-form iteration between these modalities difficult or impossible. A similar challenge exists for data as well: data abstractions often need to be adjusted; however, many data reshaping operations— particularly graph wrangling operations—have support only in programming environments that may not be accessible to many visualization designers.\n\nThis dissertation begins with an effort to better understand how graphic designers, a specific subset of the broader visualization community, work with data. The lessons from that effort inspire our remaining contributions, which are directed toward the broader community of visualization practitioners: first, we present a software model and a system that make it possible to iterate between drawing and generative visualization. Second, we present a visual technique that enables inquiry into the relationship between two specific graph data wrangling operations: pivoting and filtering. Finally, we present an interface that supports a broader range of graph data wrangling operations that enable iteration between many different graph data abstractions.\n",

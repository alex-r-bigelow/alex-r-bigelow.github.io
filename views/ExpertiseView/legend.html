    I have a sense for what this entails, but have no real experience. I'm
    looking for an excuse to learn!

  <p data-description="2">
    I've done this before&mdash;but it was a long time ago and/or it may have

    learn from others how to do it properly.

    I've done this before, or I've taken classes about it, but I haven't really
    needed it (yet) in a very applied context&mdash;I won't exactly hit the
    ground running, but it's not completely outside my wheelhouse.

    I do this frequently, or used to do it regularly as part of my job&mdash;but
    I don't have any formal training, it's been a while, and/or I'm experiencing
    some Imposter Syndrome about it. Expect it done mostly correctly, with a few
    little mistakes, fumbles, and silly questions.

    I'm a leading expert&mdash;my PhD dissertation was about this, I've
    published in top-tier academic research venues about this, and/or I've built
    software specifically to improve this process.
